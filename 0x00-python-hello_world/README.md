Description
This repository contains the solutions to the programming tasks assigned in the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. Each task focuses on a specific concept or problem in Python or C programming. The solutions provided here demonstrate the understanding and implementation of these concepts.
Run Python file: This task involves creating a shell script that runs a Python script. The name of the Python file is stored in the environment variable $PYFILE. The script should execute the Python file and display its output.

Run inline: In this task, you need to create a shell script that runs Python code stored in the environment variable $PYCODE. The script should execute the Python code and display the output.

Hello, print: For this task, you need to write a Python script that prints the message "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line, using the print function.

Print integer: This task requires completing a given Python code snippet. The code should print an integer stored in the variable number, followed by the string "Battery street", and end with a new line. You should use f-strings to format the output.

Print float: In this task, you need to complete the given Python code to print a float value stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits. The output should be in the format "Float: X.XX", where X represents the float value.

Print string: For this task, you need to complete the given Python code to print a string stored in the variable str three times, followed by its first 9 characters. The output should be in the format specified in the task description, without using any loops or conditional statements.

Play with strings: In this task, you are provided with two variables, str1 and str2. Your task is to concatenate them and print the string "Welcome to Holberton School!" using the concatenated string. The solution should be a single line of code without using any loops or conditional statements.

These tasks are designed to test your understanding and skills in Python programming. By completing these tasks, you will demonstrate your ability to work with strings, numbers, and basic Python syntax.
