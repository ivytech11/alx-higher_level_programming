Rectangle Class
This repository contains the implementation of a Rectangle class in Python. The Rectangle class represents a rectangle object and provides methods to manipulate and retrieve information about the rectangle.

Features
The Rectangle class provides the following features:

Create a Rectangle object with optional width and height.
Set and retrieve the width and height of a rectangle.
Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
Print a string representation of a rectangle using the '#' character.
Create a new rectangle instance by using the eval() function with the repr() representation.
Track the number of instances of the Rectangle class created.
File Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

0-rectangle.py: Defines an empty Rectangle class.
1-rectangle.py: Defines the Rectangle class with width and height attributes.
2-rectangle.py: Adds area and perimeter methods to the Rectangle class.
3-rectangle.py: Adds string representation to the Rectangle class.
4-rectangle.py: Adds repr() representation to the Rectangle class.
5-rectangle.py: Adds detection of instance deletion to the Rectangle class.
6-rectangle.py: Adds tracking of the number of instances to the Rectangle class.
7-rectangle.py: Changes the string representation of the Rectangle class.
Getting Started
To use the Rectangle class, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-higher_level_programming.git.
Navigate to the 0x08-python-more_classes directory: cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x08-python-more_classes.
Use the Rectangle class in your Python program by importing it.
