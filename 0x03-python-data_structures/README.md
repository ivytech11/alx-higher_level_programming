Tasks
This repository contains a series of tasks focused on Python data structures. Each task has specific requirements and objectives. The tasks are as follows:

Task 0: Print a list of integers
Objective: Write a function that prints all integers in a given list.
Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
Format: Print one integer per line.
Restrictions:
Do not import any module.
Do not cast integers into strings.
Use str.format() to print integers.
Task 1: Secure access to an element in a list
Objective: Write a function that retrieves an element from a list, similar to C.
Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
Restrictions:
If idx is negative, return None.
If idx is out of range (greater than the number of elements in my_list), return None.
Do not import any module.
Do not use try/except.
Task 2: Replace element
Objective: Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position, similar to C.
Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
Restrictions:
If idx is negative, do not modify anything and return the original list.
If idx is out of range (greater than the number of elements in my_list), do not modify anything and return the original list.
Do not import any module.
Do not use try/except.
Task 3: Print a list of integers... in reverse!
Objective: Write a function that prints all integers in a list in reverse order.
Prototype: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):
Format: Print one integer per line.
Restrictions:
Do not import any module.
Do not cast integers into strings.
Use str.format() to print integers.
Task 4: Replace in a copy
Objective: Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list, similar to C.
Prototype: def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
Restrictions:
If idx is negative, return a copy of the original list.
If idx is out of range (greater than the number of elements in my_list), return a copy of the original list.
Do not import any module.
Do not use try/except.
Task 5: Can you C me now?
Objective: Write a function that removes all occurrences of the letter 'c' (both uppercase and lowercase) from a string.
Prototype: def no_c(my_string):
Restrictions:
Do not import any module.
Do not use str.replace().
Task 6: Lists of lists = Matrix
Objective: Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
Prototype: def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):
Format: See example in the task description.
Restrictions:
Do not import any module.
Do not cast integers into strings.
Use str.format() to print integers.
Task 7: Tuples addition
Objective: Write a function that adds two tuples.
Prototype: def add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=()):
Restrictions:
Do not import any module.
If a tuple is smaller than 2, use the value 0 for each missing integer.
If a tuple is bigger than 2, use only the first 2 integers.
Task 8: More returns!
Objective: Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
Prototype: def multiple_returns(sentence):
Restrictions:
If the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None.
Task 9: Find the max
Objective: Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
Prototype: def max_integer(my_list=[]):
Restrictions:
If the list is empty, return None.
You can assume that the list only contains integers.
You are not allowed to use the built-in max() function.
Task 10: Only by 2
Objective: Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
Prototype: def divisible_by_2(my_list=[]):
Restrictions:
You are not allowed to import any module.
You are not allowed to use for, while, or eval.
Task 11: Delete at
Objective: Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
Prototype: def delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0):
Restrictions:
If idx is negative or out of range, nothing should be changed.
Task 12: Switch
Objective: Write a function that switches the values of two variables.
Prototype: def switch(a, b):
Restrictions:
You can assume a and b are both different.
Feel free to explore each task's code implementation to gain a better understanding of the functionality and requirements of each task.
