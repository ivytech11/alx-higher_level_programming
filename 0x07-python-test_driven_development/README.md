This repository contains several tasks related to test-driven development in Python. Each task is described below:

Integers Addition:

Write a function that adds two integers.
The function should raise a TypeError if the inputs are not integers or floats.
If the inputs are floats, they should be casted to integers.
Returns the sum of the two integers.
Divide a Matrix:

Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.
The matrix should be a list of lists of integers or floats.
The function should raise a TypeError if the matrix is not in the correct format.
The function should also raise a TypeError if the division parameter is not a number.
The division parameter should not be zero to avoid ZeroDivisionError.
Divides all elements of the matrix by the division parameter and rounds the result to 2 decimal places.
Returns a new matrix.
Say My Name:

Write a function that prints "My name is <first name> <last name>".
The function should raise a TypeError if either the first name or last name is not a string.
If the last name is not provided, it should be an empty string.
Prints the formatted string.
Print Square:

Write a function that prints a square using the '#' character.
The function should raise a TypeError if the size parameter is not an integer or is a negative float.
If the size is less than 0, it should raise a ValueError.
Prints the square using the specified size.
Text Indentation:

Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each '.', '?', or ':' character.
The function should raise a TypeError if the input is not a string.
Removes any leading or trailing spaces from each printed line.
Max Integer - Unittest:

Write unittests for the function 'max_integer(list)'.
The test file should be inside a 'tests' folder and use the unittest module.
The test file should be executed using the command 'python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test'.
The tests should cover various cases for finding the maximum integer in a list.
Matrix Multiplication:

Write a function that multiplies two matrices.
The matrices should be validated with specific requirements.
The function should raise appropriate exceptions for invalid input matrices.
Performs matrix multiplication and returns the resulting matrix.
Lazy Matrix Multiplication:

Write a function that multiplies two matrices using lazy evaluation.
The matrices should be validated with the same requirements as the previous task.
Performs matrix multiplication and returns the resulting matrix using lazy evaluation.
These tasks cover different aspects of test-driven development, including function implementation, exception handling, input validation, and unit testing. The tasks aim to enhance understanding and practice of these concepts in Python.
