The provided README.md file describes a programming task involving several Python scripts. Here is a summary of each task without any actual code:

Task 1: Positive or Negative

The program assigns a random signed number to the variable number.
The goal is to determine whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
The program should output the number along with the corresponding label: "is positive," "is negative," or "is zero."
Task 2: The Last Digit

The program assigns a random signed number to the variable number.
The objective is to print the last digit of the number.
The program should output the string "Last digit of," the number, the string "is," the last digit, and a message based on the last digit's value.
Task 3: Print Alphabet

The program prints the lowercase alphabet without a new line.
Task 4: Print Reversed Alphabet

The program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order without a new line.
Task 5: Uppercase Alphabet

The program prints the uppercase alphabet without a new line.
Task 6: Hexadecimal Printing

The program prints numbers from 0 to 98 along with their hexadecimal representation.
Each number is displayed in decimal and hexadecimal format, separated by a comma and a space.
Each task has a corresponding usage section explaining how to run the program and an example output section demonstrating the expected output.

The tasks are part of a larger repository named "alx-higher_level_programming," and each task has its own file within the repository's directory "0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions."
