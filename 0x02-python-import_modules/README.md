Python Import Modules
This repository contains solutions to several Python tasks related to importing modules and functions. Each task is implemented in a separate Python file. Below is a description of each task and its corresponding file.

Task 0: Import a simple function from a simple file
File: 0-add.py

This program imports the add function from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3. It demonstrates how to import a function and use it to perform a calculation.

Task 1: My first toolbox!
File: 1-calculation.py

This program imports functions from the file calculator_1.py and performs various mathematical operations using the imported functions. It prints the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using predefined variables a and b.

Task 2: How to make a script dynamic!
File: 2-args.py

This program prints the number of arguments passed to it and lists the arguments with their respective positions. It demonstrates how to access command-line arguments using sys.argv and process them in a Python script.

Task 3: Infinite addition
File: 3-infinite_add.py

This program takes any number of command-line arguments and performs their addition. It prints the result of the addition, even for large numbers. It demonstrates how to handle command-line arguments dynamically and perform arithmetic operations on them.

Task 4: Who are you?
File: 4-hidden_discovery.py

This program reads a compiled module file named hidden_4.pyc and prints all the names defined in it. It prints each name on a separate line in alphabetical order, excluding names that start with __. It demonstrates how to inspect and access names defined in a compiled module.

Task 5: Everything can be imported
File: 5-variable_load.py

This program imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value. It demonstrates how to import a specific variable from a module and use it in a different script.

Feel free to explore the files in this repository to see the solutions for each task.
