Task 0: Squared simple
The script 0-square_matrix_simple.py contains a function square_matrix_simple(matrix) that computes the square value of all integers in a given matrix. The function takes a 2-dimensional array (matrix) as input and returns a new matrix of the same size. In the new matrix, each value is the square of the corresponding value in the input matrix. The original matrix is not modified, and no external modules are imported.

Task 1: Search and replace
The script 1-search_replace.py contains a function search_replace(my_list, search, replace) that replaces all occurrences of a given element (search) with another element (replace) in a new list. The function takes an initial list (my_list) as input and returns a new list where all occurrences of search are replaced with replace. No external modules are imported.

Task 2: Unique addition
The script 2-uniq_add.py contains a function uniq_add(my_list) that adds all unique integers in a given list, considering each integer only once. The function takes a list (my_list) as input and returns the sum of all unique integers. No external modules are imported.

Task 3: Present in both
The script 3-common_elements.py contains a function common_elements(set_1, set_2) that returns a set of common elements present in two given sets. The function takes two sets (set_1 and set_2) as input and returns a set containing the common elements between them. No external modules are imported.

Task 4: Only differents
The script 4-only_diff_elements.py contains a function only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2) that returns a set of elements present in only one of the given sets. The function takes two sets (set_1 and set_2) as input and returns a set containing elements that are present in only one of the sets. No external modules are imported.

Task 5: Number of keys
The script 5-number_keys.py contains a function number_keys(a_dictionary) that returns the number of keys in a given dictionary. The function takes a dictionary (a_dictionary) as input and returns the count of keys present in the dictionary. No external modules are imported.

Each script addresses a specific task and provides a solution using Python programming concepts. They are standalone scripts and can be executed independently to perform their respective tasks. The examples in the README.md file demonstrate the usage and expected output for each script.
Task 6: Print sorted dictionary
The script 6-print_sorted_dictionary.py contains a function print_sorted_dictionary(my_dict) that prints a dictionary in a specific format. The function takes a dictionary (my_dict) as input and prints its keys and values in alphabetical order based on the keys. The output is formatted as "Key: Value" for each key-value pair in the dictionary. No external modules are imported.

Task 7: Update dictionary
The script 7-update_dictionary.py contains a function update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value) that updates a dictionary with a new key-value pair. The function takes a dictionary (a_dictionary), a key (key), and a value (value) as input. If the key already exists in the dictionary, its value is updated with the new value. If the key doesn't exist, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary. The updated dictionary is then returned. No external modules are imported.

Task 8: Simple delete by key
The script 8-simple_delete.py contains a function simple_delete(a_dictionary, key="" that deletes a key from a dictionary. The function takes a dictionary (a_dictionary) and a key (key) as input. If the key exists in the dictionary, it is removed along with its associated value. The updated dictionary is then returned. If the key is not provided or is an empty string, the function returns the original dictionary unchanged. No external modules are imported.

Task 9: Multiply by 2
The script 9-multiply_by_2.py contains a function multiply_by_2(a_dictionary) that creates a new dictionary by multiplying the values of a given dictionary by 2. The function takes a dictionary (a_dictionary) as input and returns a new dictionary where each value is the double of the corresponding value in the input dictionary. The original dictionary is not modified. No external modules are imported.

Task 10: Best score
The script 10-best_score.py contains a function best_score(a_dictionary) that returns the key with the highest value in a dictionary. The function takes a dictionary (a_dictionary) as input and returns the key corresponding to the highest value. If multiple keys have the same highest value, the function returns the first key encountered during iteration. If the dictionary is empty, the function returns None. No external modules are imported.

These scripts provide solutions to various dictionary-related tasks, such as manipulating dictionary elements, updating dictionaries, and retrieving specific information from dictionaries. They demonstrate different ways to work with dictionaries in Python.
Task 11: Square by Value
The script 11-square_by_value.py contains a function square_dict(my_dict) that creates a new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but the values are the square of the corresponding values in the input dictionary. The function takes a dictionary (my_dict) as input and returns a new dictionary where each value is the square of the corresponding value in the input dictionary. The original dictionary is not modified. No external modules are imported.

Task 12: Only differents keys
The script 12-only_diff_elements.py contains a function only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2) that returns a set containing only the unique elements from two input sets. The function takes two sets (set_1 and set_2) as input and returns a new set that contains only the elements that are present in either set_1 or set_2, but not in both. No external modules are imported.

Task 13: Number of keys
The script 13-number_keys.py contains a function number_keys(my_dict) that returns the number of keys in a dictionary. The function takes a dictionary (my_dict) as input and returns an integer value representing the number of keys in the dictionary. No external modules are imported.

Task 14: Update dictionary
The script 14-update_dictionary_keys.py contains a function update_dictionary_keys(a_dictionary, key, value) that updates a dictionary by adding a new key-value pair or modifying an existing key-value pair. The function takes a dictionary (a_dictionary), a key (key), and a value (value) as input. If the key exists in the dictionary, its value is updated with the new value. If the key doesn't exist, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary. The updated dictionary is then returned. No external modules are imported.

Task 15: Multiply by using map
The script 15-multiply_list_map.py contains a function multiply_list_map(my_list=[], multiplier=2) that multiplies each element in a list by a specified multiplier using the map function. The function takes a list (my_list) and an integer (multiplier) as input and returns a new list where each element is the result of multiplying the corresponding element in the input list by the multiplier. If the list is not provided, it defaults to an empty list. No external modules are imported.

These scripts provide solutions to various dictionary and list-related tasks, showcasing different techniques and functions in Python for manipulating and processing data.
